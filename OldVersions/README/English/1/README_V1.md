### [Malware as art](#Malware-as-art)

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I consider malware to be a form of art [:octocat: `under certain conditions`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Malware-as-art/).

### [Ransomware](#Ransomware)

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I do not produce ransomware, as I see it as pointless, and not a form of art. [:octocat: `More information on ransomware`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Ransomware-Info/)

### [Disclaimer](#Disclaimer)

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

These links contain malware projects. They are intended for use only within a virtual machine by someone who knows what they are doing. Any other use is on you, I am not liable for any damage caused to files for failing to follow this instruction, even if your entire hard drive is destroyed, there is unfortunately nothing else I can/could do.

### [Some protection](#Some-protection)

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

[:octocat: `Linux Defender`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux_Defender/) is one of the tools I produce that can detect and prevent malware on Linux.

### [Autorun](#Autorun)

My malware does not activate the moment you run it. It will ask for confirmation first. My malware tries to include Pro-VM code (source code that can detect if you are using a virtual machine, and only let the software run inside of one) this is different from anti-VM code (source code that can detect if you are using a virtual machine, and forbid any usage whatsoever while it sees you are in one) which I am strongly opposed to. The Pro-VM code is a safety measure that can also easily be disabled if needed.
